## Description 
In this particular week, I embarked on the task of creating a professional README.md file generator using the Inquirer npm package. The application's initial steps involve prompting the user for essential details such as their username and email. Subsequently, it proceeds to inquire about various other aspects in alignment with the guidelines for crafting a professional README.md file. Moreover, I implemented a logic that detects if the user opts to skip a prompt; consequently, any skipped prompts will not appear in the generated README.md file. Undoubtedly, this endeavor presented numerous challenges, especially considering it was my first foray into backend development. Nonetheless, I thrive when faced with adversity and relish the opportunity to tackle new challenges head-on.
